# Unreal Engine Launcher

## Why

Made without the permission of Epic Games, this project was born out of my frustration working with
the Epic Games Launcher's Unreal Engine Library, where it is currently impossible to see all the projects
on your local machine, sort said projects by date (to determine when they were last worked on), and filter by
arbitrary tags or categories.

## What

This application is an attempt to address the issues mentioned above. As of now, the application boots (quite fast, I might add)
and allows users to select arbitrary directories to scan for Unreal Engine projects. Once the directory is scanned, the project view
is populated, and the sorting and filtering options should help the user find what they're looking for.

## Future

Some ideas for future development:

- A "Recent Projects" side panel
- Add custom tags to projects for better filtering
- Cloning projects to a new directory
- Installing and updating new engine versions
- A Fab Library window
- The ability to manage the local Asset Vault

## How to use

Builds have been uploaded to the release folder within the main directory. Select the version you need and download it as a ZIP file. 
After extracting the files, the application should run by selecting the .exe file.

## How to Add Features

If this project resonates with you, and you'd like to work on it and improve it, please do! The licence is MIT Open Source, so you 
may take this as a base for your own application, but I would appreciate it if this repo was kept alive with any useful updates.

The project uses the Flutter framework. If you need any help setting yourself up for working with flutter, or just if you want to 
build from source (to another platform, for example), please visit https://flutter.dev/.
